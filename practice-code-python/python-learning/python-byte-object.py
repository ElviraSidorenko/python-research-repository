# Python Byte Object

# Streaming files
# Transmitting text without knowing the encoding
# Often used 'under the hood' in Python libraries


# Creates an empty bytes object that is 4-bytes long

bytes(4)  # b'\x00\x00\x00\x00'


# Bytes object has a 'b' in front of it to differentiate it from the string.

# Leveraging Python byte objects can enhance software design by promoting modularity, encapsulation, and abstraction.
# When used appropriately, byte objects contribute to a more organized, maintainable, and robust software architecture.
