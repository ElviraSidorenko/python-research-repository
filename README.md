# Research Repository
Welcome to the Research Repository! This repository is a collection of code and projects created during my studies and research. The repository is organized into two main folders: **Software Project** and **Practice Code in Python**.

## Software Project
### Help Desk Ticketing System
This folder contains a fully functional Help Desk ticketing system written in Python. The system is designed to streamline and organize support requests efficiently. Below is a brief overview of the project structure:

help-desk-ticket-system.py: the main file with the Python code.
README.md: Instructions and documentation for the Help Desk system.
For more detailed information on how to use and contribute to the Help Desk ticketing system, please refer to the README.md file inside the folder.

## Practice Code in Python
This folder contains various Python code snippets and projects created during the learning process. The practice code is organized into three subfolders:

### Python Challenges
The python-challenges folder consists of solutions to various Python challenges, each accompanied by detailed comments explaining the thought process and implementation details. This section is a great resource for honing problem-solving skills and mastering Python coding techniques.

### Python Learning
In the python-learning folder, you will find Python concepts and terms explained with code examples. Each file serves as a mini-lesson, providing insights into different aspects of Python programming.

### Software Principles
The software-principles folder is dedicated to explaining various software principles with practical Python code examples and detailed comments. Understanding these principles is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. This section serves as a valuable reference for software engineering best practices.

Feel free to explore each folder to enhance your Python skills and gain insights into software development principles. Each file in this repository is well-commented, providing explanations and insights to assist in the learning process.
